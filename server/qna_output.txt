Q: What does Spreads mean?
A: In trading, the term spread refers to the difference between the buy (ask) and sell (bid) price of an asset. The spread is an important factor in derivatives trading and determines how derivatives - such as contracts for difference (CFDs) - are priced.

Q: What does Margin, Free Margin, Margin Level, Swap means?
A: Trading on margin means that you borrow funds from the broker to buy securities. You only pay a certain percentage (or margin) of the value. This allows you to trade beyond your available balance.
Trading on margin allows you to trade beyond your available cash. You borrow money from the broker to do this.
The free margin is the sum of your own capital that is not tied up in any position and that you can use for new positions in the market. But that is not all, because the free margin is also the difference between your equity and your already deposited margin.
The margin level is the percentage of your equity in the collateral used. In other words, it is the ratio of equity to margin. Margin Level = (Equity/Margin Used) x 100.
The swap is a typical trading fee in Forex and CFD trading. As they are leveraged derivatives, a financing fee (swap) of the trading position is required. The swap depends on the position size, asset, leverage and broker.

Q: What are Margin Call and Stop Out?
A: "Margin Call” shall mean the situation when the trading account of a Client does not have enough Margin to open new or maintain open positions, where the system does not allow to open new position and starts to close open position when margin level is below 10%.
When the "stop-out" level is reached, the trade is closed at the first price available at the time of closing, which means that the final outcome may differ from the outcome expected based on the specified stop-out level.

Q: What is a CFD?
A: Contract for Difference (CFD) is the name of a derivative financial product that can be used to speculate on underlying securities (such as shares) without actually holding them. A derivative or derivative security is a security whose value or performance depends on the performance of one or more underlying assets.

Q: What is leverage?
A: Leverage means that you as a trader can move significantly more capital in the market with a leverage product than you actually invested when you bought the leverage product. Let's assume, for example, that you buy 100 CFDs that refer to a DAX share.
The share listed in the DAX has the regular price of 100 EURO. If you were to buy the shares regularly, you would have to invest 10,000 Euros when buying 100 shares.
However, if you buy the CFDs of the share listed in the DAX, you only have to invest 5% of the sum yourself.
The rest is "lent" to you by the broker, so to speak. So you can buy 100 CFDS of the share and you only have to deposit 100 euros for it.
In addition, there is a security deposit to be made, the so-called margin. The amount of the margin varies. In our example, we assume 5%.
If the share price rises, the value of the position is 10,100 euros. You have thus made a profit of 100 euros.
Since your stake was only 100 euros, you have actually achieved a return of 100% with this transaction.
This is also applicable when the market conditions are not in your favor and thus you may lose 100 euros.

Q: What is the formula to calculate Swap?
A: To calculate the charges for Forex & Equities, please use this formula: (lots * Swap for Long or short in points)
Here’s an example: Long (Buy) 0.01 Lot EURUSD, Swap rate for Long is -7.922 points.
The end of day market rate is 1.19097 for EURUSD. The client’s account currency is EUR.
Therefore, the Swap Rate Calculation is as follows: 0.01* (-7.922) / 1.19097 (conversion to account currency) = - €0.07.
Here’s an example: Short (Sell) 0.2 Lots EURUSD.
The Swap rate for Short is 5.3 points, and the client’s account currency USD.
Therefore, the Swap Rate Calculation: 0.2 * 5.3 = $1.06

Q: What is the formula used for calculating Margin?
A: Margin calculation Dax (Margin requirement 5% = Leverage 1:20)
Lots x current market price x 5% / 100% = Margin
1 Lot x 13.998.5 x 5 / 100 = 699.925 EUR Margin for 1 Lot

Q: Do you allow hedging?
A: No, we do not allow hedging.
